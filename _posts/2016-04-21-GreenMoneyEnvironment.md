At CleanRobotics, we believe that sustainability just plain makes sense from a business perspective. Customers all over the world, but especially millennials, are more likely to buy from businesses that show concern for the environment and sustainability. Consider these statistics:

* 45% of U.S. Millennials said that environmental stewardship is more important to them as a value now than it was two years ago. [*source: www.bcgperspectives.com*]( https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/marketing_center_consumer_customer_insight_how_millennials_changing_marketing_forever/?chapter=3)
* 66% of global respondents say they’re willing to pay more for products and services that come from companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact, up from 55% in 2014, and 50% in 2013. [*source: www.bcgperspectives.com* ](https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/marketing_center_consumer_customer_insight_how_millennials_changing_marketing_forever/?chapter=3)
* More than half of global consumers (53 %/representing 1.1 billion people) prefer to purchase products and services from a company with a strong environmental reputation, according to a new global [survey](http://www.tandberg.com/vcb/tandberg-green-survey.jsp) released by video-conferencing company Tandberg. While a majority of consumers globally prefer purchasing from companies with a strong environmental reputation, the figure was particularly high in China, with 67 % of consumers concurring. Australia came in second with 52 %, and Sweden came in third with 46%.

Green initiatives go hand in hand with increased revenue, not just in the US but all over the globe as represented by these findings. In order to appeal to consumers with stronger preferences for being environmentally friendly, many companies are pursuing a *zero waste policy.*

What is *zero waste*? Zero Waste means designing and managing products and processes to systematically avoid and eliminate the volume and toxicity of waste and materials, conserve and recover all resources, and not burn or bury them. [*source: wikipedia.org*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_waste)

Companies as diverse as Walmart, Subaru and Nestle are subscribing to zero waste. [Walmart declares](http://corporate.walmart.com/global-responsibility/sustainability/): “Our aspirational goal of achieving zero waste across our global operations is bold, but we continue to make measurable progress. In the U.S., more than 81% of the materials that flow through our stores, clubs, and distribution centers is being diverted from landfills. Our operations in Japan and the U.K. lead the way with a diversion rate of more than 90%, while Walmart Canada and Walmart Mexico divert more than 70%.”

[Subaru lays claim](http://www.subaru.com/csr/environment.html) to “becoming America’s first zero landfill auto maker”. [Nestle USA last year achieved](http://waste360.com/features/20-companies-zero-waste-landfill-operations#slide-2-field_images-209791) landfill-free status at all of its U.S.-based facilities.

At CleanRobotics, we support this process and are contributing to it with our smart TrashBot waste bins that can isolate recyclable materials from landfill waste. Imagine if your company did not have to rely on costly manual audits to keep track of your building waste…. If you were able to get a real time picture of your office and kitchen waste, you could be more proactive. You could understand the biggest drivers of waste and take steps to minimize or eliminate them! Your offices would be more attractive for millennial workers and your business could benefit from sustainable practices.

Happy Earth month to everyone supporting sustainability and smarter recycling initiatives this month from us at CleanRobotics!
