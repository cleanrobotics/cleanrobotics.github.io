Have you been to the land down under? 

CleanRobotics is headed there later this month, to the [Chatswood Chase Sydney](https://www.chatswoodchasesydney.com.au/) mall in Sydney, Australia! We’re partnering with [Vicinity Centres](http://www.vicinity.com.au/), one of the largest mall operators in Australia, to pilot two of our units. If you find yourself in need of some last-minute holiday shopping, head to the Chatswood Chase Sydney and keep your eyes peeled for our TrashBots. We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback. #TrashBot

Vicinity Centres has demonstrated a strong commitment to [sustainability and community engagement](http://sustainability.vicinity.com.au/), and we are honored to be a part of their efforts. We’re currently hard at work building the two units, which will feature snazzy white plastic tops. Here’s a sneak peak:

More photos to come. We'll let you know when they're en route to Sydney!
