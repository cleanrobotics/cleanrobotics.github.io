CleanRobotics just wrapped up a pilot with the City of Pittsburgh ‘s innovation arm called PGH Lab.


PGH Lab describes their mission as:
“The PGH Lab program provides a platform where local startups use technology to make the City of Pittsburgh more efficient, sustainable, and inclusive.” 

And boasts of benefits, apart from providing the startups a real environment to test their prototypes in, like:

	Co-Working Space

	Access to many global incubators

CleanRobotics is proud to have been part of the 2017 Cohort and gained amazing experience during the pilot along with other innovative startup from the region.

We will share the results of the pilot along with learnings in our next post but in this post,  but here we want people to learn more about the program at PGH Lab.




We sat down with Annia Aleman - Civic Innovation Specialist at the PGH Lab to help people learn more about the program.

1.How would you define the program at PGH Labs and its benefits for startups?


Annia - The PGH Lab program brings local startups to test products and services at the City of Pittsburgh and participating authorities for 3-4 months. The program targets early stage startups with a working prototype so that they can test products and services in a real-world environment and gain as much feedback on the product as possible. In addition, participating companies get to work with a city staff that acts as mentor and provides feedback on the product/service, access to the city’s network, co-working space, and free membership to 1776 UNION online global incubator. 



2.What are the criteria used to determine and select the companies which would be part of the program? 

Annia -  Startups are evaluated in the following criteria: 
Innovation based solution: Solution address the challenge creatively and effectively, is compatible with or flexible to work with City’s IT infrastructure and City requirements. 
Skills, Experience, and Background: Professional qualifications and education of team members, the existence or (lack thereof) existing and working prototypes, recent relevant experience of team members. 
Impact: The proposed solution has potential to benefit the City and residents. 
Inclusion: The Company’s commitment to the principles of diversity and inclusion.  
 --– Has the selection been difficult?
Annia - Not at all, companies are evaluated based on the criteria above and a scoring mechanism by the PGH Lab review committee. The companies with the highest scores move on to the second part of the selection process which includes a company presentation and an opportunity for Q&A.



3.What are some of the positive outcomes from the program? 

Annia -  We are still learning as we go. However, after completing the pilot projects companies gain a deeper understanding of how their products/services work in a real world environment and they also learn the ins and out of working with local government. 



4.You supported our team a lot in the program for all logistics and system needs and we would like to thank you for the support, in line with this how would you define your role in the program? 

Annia - I coordinate the program, serve a liaison between the startups and city government, and also work in the Roadmap for Inclusive Innovation team. 



5.What do you think the future holds for the program? 

Annia -  The City of Pittsburgh and participating authorities will launch a third cycle of the program in late October. We hope to engage more local startups and to keep providing a platform for them to test their innovative products and services. In addition, we hope to grow our testing network by bringing in new partners.
