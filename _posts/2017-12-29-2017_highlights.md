It’s almost 2018, and the CleanRobotics team is looking forward to kicking off the new year with some exciting pilots and a new version of the TrashBot! We’re thankful for the support of our mentors, investors, and the community in helping us to create a TrashBot that best serves your needs! In 2017 alone, we were able to design and manufacture two different iterations of the TrashBot, as seen here:
