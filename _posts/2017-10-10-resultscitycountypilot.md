TrashBot at City County Building – PGH Lab Pilot – What we learned?

As explained in the previous post [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/09/29/citycountypilot), (if you haven’t read it already), CleanRobotics was part of the 2017 PGH Lab Innovation program, which. provided us with an opportunity to publicly showcase and test our flagship product, the TrashBot . TrashBot is an automated, smart trash can that combines next-generation robotics, computer vision, and machine learning to sort recyclable materials from non-recyclable waste. During the week of 9/11 – 9/15, one TrashBot was deployed in the City County Building in downtown Pittsburgh, where we were able to collect valuable feedback from curious passersby and the employees at the Coty County Building.
 
Trashbot attracted a lot of attention from the public and the employees at the City County building. People were impressed by getting to witness a product which leverages technology to help save the planet. TrashBot is tackling the problem of contamination in recycling, which is a huge challenge that governments and corporations are trying to mitigate. TrashBot aims to solve the problem by separating the waste at the point of disposal. As the waste stream gets mixed, it becomes harder to use processes to separate recycling materials effectively. According to Waste Management, America's largest recycler, the industry is experiencing a "national crisis," with almost all of America's 2,000 high-tech recycling facilities running in the red.  There are several reasons for this, but the most significant is contamination resulting from inaccurate human sorting.   
Our award-winning product, TrashBot, is an automated, smart trash can that combines next-generation robotics, computer vision and machine learning to sort recyclables from non-recyclable material.

Based on surveys and conversations with employees and members of the public, we could determine the following:

1. The top reasons for people not separating their waste into recycling and landfill waste are “Lack of knowledge about materials they are disposing” and “Lack of knowledge about different types of receptacles.”

2. The majority of the respondents described our product as “Unique” and “Innovative,” and 81% rated the design and build “Above Average.”

3. 60% of respondents liked the sleek design of the TrashBot, although many felt that it was too large. 

4. Several people suggested that the TrashBot needs to sort more quickly in order to make it easier to use.

5. A fun suggestion: TrashBot should play music to attract attention in hallways and public places.  

To everyone who stopped by to chat with us and fill out the survey – thank you! Your comments and feedback will allow us to make a better, more user-friendly product. Based on the primarily positive feedback, it’s clear that we are on the right track.

The PGH Lab Innovation program was not only an opportunity for us to collect data, but a demonstration of the many wonderful projects and potential collaborations that are evolving within the Pittsburgh community. Partnerships were formed between a number of local startups and government entities, including:

PGH Lab Companies and their reporting authorities:
-Clean Robotics & City of Pittsburgh
-Cognowear & Urban Redevelopment Authority
-MellonHead Labs & Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority
-FlyWheel & Urban Redevelopment Authority
-Kaarta & City of Pittsburgh

Thus, every startup had a reporting authority and a mentor champion assigned to them who worked to guide them during the length of the program. This enabled the startups to better understand a subset of the markets and clients that they hope to serve, while also giving their government partners a glimpse of the future! The program ended with a celebration, with speeches from each of the startup founders, their mentors, and the city officials who made the program possible.  From each and every one of those speeches, it was clear that the program was a great success. We are incredibly thankful to have been a part. 

Beyond the valuable feedback and public exposure that we received, it was immensely motivating for us to see the enthusiasm with which the public embraced the idea of automatic waste sorting. The product that we build and the work that we do is informed by people like you! So be sure to keep a lookout for TrashBot and let us know what you think. We look forward to serving the city of Pittsburgh in the near future.
