                    <p class="text-muted">Recycling can be difficult. Rules differ from place to place, and regulations change, leaving the recycler--you--confused. Recycling remains the one process that corporations cannot effectively measure. The burden of recycling is placed on individuals, reducing the effectiveness of recycling programs and resulting in recyclable material ending up in landfills.</p>
